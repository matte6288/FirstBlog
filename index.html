          <div class="split-bio">
            <p>I learned about IBM's innovations in Quantuam computing in the ACM article I read over the weekend. First of all I learned what a quantuam computer was. From was I dirived from the article a quantum computer is a computer that instead of bits, pieces that can store a data value of 1 or 0, a quantuam computer uses quanbits. These instead can store the number 1 and 0 or store any number between 1 and 0. This leads to data being processed at an extremely fast rate because instead of each bit being yes or no it can have an almost infite amount of possiblity for what it is storing and change it at an extremely fast rate. Currently a Chinese organaztion has the fastest quantuam computer, storing 4 quanbits. Currently IBM is constructing a computer with 16 quanbits and will use the computer to model reactions of differents atoms interacting on an sureal level. The machine now has a 98% percent success rate but can only model small atoms. IBM is hoping to improve this to way to closer to 100% and be able to process large atoms interactions. With these innovtions on the way who knows when we will have quantum ultrafast computers in our own home!   </p>

            <p>A good cyber citizen looks like a good citizen in the real world. You would not do anything online that you wouldn't do in real life. The internet does not protect you from being anonymous something can always get out. My biggest take away from the reading of "Blown to Bits" was just be a good person online or in person because words and actions are stored in either peoples memories or in a data storage center. One also never know how information from your past could be used to harm your future. In the future this ideal may become even more extreme with data storage becoming more an more accessible.</p>
